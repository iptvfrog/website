			<article class="full">There are a couple of ways that you can earn referrals:</article>
			<h2>Using Your Name</h2>
			<article class="full">An easy way to get referrals is to simply have the person that you are referring to IPTV Frog <b>enter your name into the referral box during the order process</b>. When the new customer starts the order process, they will be asked if they were referred by anyone, at which point they can enter your name.</article><br>
			<article class="full">Because referral credits can only be earned on new signups, the referral box will only show up if the customer selects that they are a <b>new customer</b>. If they select that they are a renewing customer, the referral option will not display.</article><br>
			<article class="full">The name entered in the referral box <b><u>must match the name on your own IPTV Frog account</u></b>. Incorrect names will not match our system and no referral credit will be earned for that transaction. If you aren’t sure what name you used on your IPTV Frog account, email us and tell us the phone number or email address linked to your account.</article>
			<h2>Using Your Web Link</h2>
			<article class="full">Another easy way to promote IPTV Frog and earn referrals is to <b>share your referral web link</b>. This link will direct customers to the IPTV Frog homepage, where they can learn more about what we have to offer and place an order. This link will automatically fill in your name and will earn you a referral credit if they are a new signup.</article><br>
			<article class="full"><b>This link is perfect for sharing on social media, emailing to your friends or embedding on your blog!</b></article><br>
			<article class="full">If a potential customer clicks on your referral link, but doesn’t place an order, we will attempt to give you a referral credit if they <b>place an order within 30 days of clicking your link</b>. <i>(Some restrictions apply. See terms and conditions for details.)</i></article><br>
			<article class="full">Getting your referral link is easy! Simply <b>fill out your name</b> in the box below and your link will be generated.</article><br>
			<article class="full">The name entered in the box below <b><u>must match the name on your own IPTV Frog account</u></b>. Incorrect names will not match our system and no referral credit will be earned for that transaction. If you aren’t sure what name you used on your IPTV Frog account, email us and tell us the phone number or email address linked to your account.</article><br>
