Please read carefully the following terms and conditions (this “Agreement”) and the Privacy Policy. This Agreement governs your access to and use of the Site, Web Services, Data and Third Party Data, and constitutes a binding legal agreement between you (referred to herein as “You” or “Customer”) and Provider.<br><br>
			
			<b>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY CLICKING THE CHECKBOX OR BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE, WEB SERVICES, DATA OR THIRD PARTY DATA, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SITE, WEB SERVICES, DATA OR THIRD PARTY DATA.</b> If you accept or agree to this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to this Agreement and, in such event; “Customer”, “You” and “Your” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.
			
			<h4>Definitions</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><u>“Web Services”</u> consist of a set of software programs, interfaces, and webpages running on computers hosted at Provider sites or at third-party hosting facilities accessible via the Internet as described in this Agreement and the Site.</li>
				<li><u>“Data”</u> means the prices and other market data that is (i) owned by Provider and (ii) obtained by Provider from exchanges and other sources delivered to Customer via the Web Services and as described in this Agreement and on the Site.</li>

				<li><u>“Data Owner”</u> means a legal entity that holds ownership rights to some of the Data or Third Party Data (defined below) and is the original licensing source of such portion of the Data or Third Party Data when such portion of the Data or Third Party Data is not in the public domain. In cases of Third Party Data, Provider has secured redistribution agreements with the Data Owner.</li>
				<li><u>“Distinct Software Applications”</u> means software applications that automate substantially different business products, services, processes or functions of Customer. Provider reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make a reasonable determination as to whether software applications that use the Web Services or the Data or Third Party Data constitute Distinct Software Applications.</li>
				<li><u>“Data Exchange Format”</u> means an electronic version of the Data or Third Party Data used for sharing the Data or Third Party Data between software applications, including but not limited to any application programming interface (API), any database access (e.g., ODBC, etc.), any network transmission format (e.g., EDI, SOAP, RSS, XML, etc.) and any data file format (e.g., XLS, CSV, etc.). Provider reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine if a particular electronic version of the Data or Third Party Data constitutes a Data Exchange Format.</li>
				<li><u>“Subscription Plan”</u> means all the subscription plans selected by the Customer in connection with the purchase of the use of the Web Services, Data and Third Party Data. The Provider posts the available subscription plans and the specific use of the Web Services, Data and Third Party Data provided by each subscription plan on the Site, as they may be updated by the Provider from time to time.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Modification</h4>
			Provider reserves the right to modify, discontinue or terminate the Site, Web Services, Data and Third Party Data or to modify this Agreement, at any time and without prior notice. If Provider modifies this Agreement, Provider will post the modification on the Site or provide you with notice of the modification. Provider will also update the “Last Updated Date” at the bottom of this Agreement. By continuing to access or use the Site, Web Services, Data and Third Party Data after Provider has posted a modification on the Site or has provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Agreement. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to You, Your only recourse is to cease using the Site, Web Services, Data and Third Party Data.

Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate Your Account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding Your MAC address. You agree not to disclose Your MAC address to any third party and to take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under Your Account, whether or not You have authorized such activities or actions.

			<h4>Licenses & Data</h4>
			<u>Web Services License.</u> Subject to Customer’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Provider grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, license to access and use the Web Services solely for its business purposes. This Agreement governs Customer’s access to and use of the Web Services and the Site. Customer acknowledges and agrees that but for this Agreement, Customer would have no rights or access to the Web Services and the Site.<br><br>

			<u>Rights in Data License.</u> Subject to Customer’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Provider grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, license to access and use the Data and Third Party Data available via the Web Services solely for its business purposes. In addition, any Third Party Data may be subject to restrictions of use and require additional license agreements with the Data Owner. While Provider may, in its sole discretion, offer administrative assistance to Customer in obtaining such additional licenses, Customer is solely responsible for obtaining all required license agreements with each Data Owner pursuant to Customer’s use of such Third Party Data. If Customer does not obtain a required license agreement for any portion of the Third Party Data and as such is in violation of the Data Owner’s licensing requirements, Provider may terminate access to the unlicensed portion of Third Party Data until Customer obtains such license agreements with the Data Owner.<br><br>

			<u>Proprietary Rights.</u> Subject to the limited rights expressly granted hereunder, Customer acknowledges that the Data, Third Party Data, Web Services, Site, and/or any developments to the Data, Third Party Data, Web Services, and Site that result from services provided under the Support Plan (“Developments”) provided to Customer hereunder are proprietary in nature and owned exclusively by Provider and/or the Data Owners.

			</ul>

			<u>Restrictions on the Data and Third Party Data.</u>
			<ul>
				<li>Customer may use the Data and Third Party Data solely with any software application owned or licensed by Customer.</li>

				<li>Customer may cache and store the Data and Third Party Data for use within each Distinct Software Application provided such use is in compliance with restrictions imposed by the Data Owners. The Data or Third Party Data may not be shared between Distinct Software Applications or made available in any Data Exchange Format for the purpose of sharing between Distinct Software Applications.</li>

			<h4>Term & Termination</h4>
			<u>Term.</u> This Agreement will commence when You place your order and shall continue for the Subscription Plan. This Agreement shall continue from the Start Date through the initial term specified by the Subscription Plan (the “Initial Term”). At the end of the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically renew on the day following the last day of the Initial Term (“First Renewal Date”) and will automatically renew thereafter on the first day of each renewal period (“Renewal Period”) as specified by the Subscription Plan, unless either party provides to the other written or electronic notice of termination in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Initial Term specified by the Start Date and the First Renewal Date of the Subscription Plan, and each subsequent renewal term specified by the First Renewal Date and the Renewal Period of the Subscription Plan are collectively the “Term”.<br><br>

			<u>Right to Terminate.</u> After the Start Date, either Party may terminate this Agreement for any reason prior to the beginning of each renewal term as indicated by the First Renewal Date and the Renewal Period of the Subscription Plan by delivering written or electronic notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of each renewal term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may terminate this Agreement at any time in the event that the other party breaches any material term of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within ten (10) business days after receipt of a written notice of any such breach, or if such breach cannot be remedied within that period of time, fails to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the non-breaching party that it is taking steps reasonably necessary to remedy the breach.<br><br>

			<u>Inability to Provide Data and Third Party Data.</u> If Provider ever loses the license, right or ability to provide any portion of the Data or Third Party Data, or such license or right is ever interrupted or otherwise impaired, then Provider is not responsible for notifying the Client and is not obligated to refund the Subscription Plan.<br><br>

			<u>Survival.</u> The provisions of the Definitions Section and Sections that by their nature should reasonably survive, and any amendments to the provisions of the aforementioned will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.<br><br>
			
			<u>Agreement Violations.</u> Provider reserves the right to revoke a Customer’s account if the Customer has violated the provisions outlined by this agreement. Provider is not obligated to provide a refund for time remaining on their Subscription Plan. A Customer’s account can also be permanently locked and the Customer can be prohibited from ordering a Subscription Plan at the sole discretion of the Provider. 

			<h4>Fees</h4>
			<u>Subscription Fees.</u> Customer will pay to Provider fees in connection with the Subscription Plan selected by Customer to use the Web Services, Data, and Third Party Data (“Subscription Fees”). Thereafter, Subscription Fees for Customer’s use of the Web Services, Data and Third Party Data shall be (i) as described and/or as selected by You via the Site in connection with purchase to use the Web Services, Data and Third Party Data or (ii) negotiated between You and Provider by creating an addendum to this Agreement. Unless otherwise negotiated between You and Provider in an addendum to this agreement, all Subscription Fees are due at the beginning of each subscription term as specified in the Subscription Plan and You are responsible for ensuring complete payment in a timely manner. Provider is not responsible for any service outages as a result of late payment or failed payment. Subscription Fees are exclusive of taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, VAT) (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer shall be responsible for payment of all Taxes and any related interest and/or penalties resulting from any payments made hereunder, other than any taxes based on Provider’s net income.

			<h4>Support Services</h4>
			<u>Service Level.</u> Provider will use its reasonable business efforts to ensure that the Web Services operate according to the service levels, except for reasonable service interruptions due to Excusable Delays (defined below) or regularly scheduled maintenance. Provider further agrees that it will use its reasonable business efforts to prevent and/or rapidly respond to and remedy any interruption to the operation of the Web Services caused by third parties from unlicensed use, viruses, malicious code, denial of service attacks, or other external tampering with the Web Services. <b>HOWEVER, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, PROVIDER MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTY REGARDING THE OPERATION OF THE WEB SERVICES.</b><br><br>

			<u>Customer Responsibilities.</u> Customer will promptly report any errors in the operation of the Web Services to Provider and will not take any actions that would increase the severity of the error. Customer will use the Web Services solely as described herein. In the event that Customer violates any of the requirements of this Section, Provider will have no responsibility to provide Support.<br><br>
			
			<u>Support Time Compensation.</u> Customer agrees that Provider is not obligated to offer monetary refunds or service extensions to compensate for the time lost on the Customer's Subscription Plan as a result of the troubleshooting and issue resolution process. While Provider agrees to provide support services in a timely manner, with the cooperation of the Customer, Provider does not guarantee that a support service will be provided within a specified timeframe.

			<h4>Bring Your Own Device</h4>
			<u>Right To Access Web Services.</u> Provider agrees that the Customer may use the Web Services on a Third Party Device, meaning a device that was not purchased or otherwise provided to the Customer by the Provider, as long as they have a valid Subscription Plan. Provider agrees not to restrict access to the Web Services if Customer is connecting from a Third Party Device.<br><br>
			
			<u>Support Service Limitations.</u> While the Provider will provide the standard Support Service (defined above), the Provider is not obligated to provide support for issues that result from using a Third Party Device. This includes but is not limited to Web Service configuration issues and Third Party Device faults or failures.<br><br>
			
			<u>Device Compatibility.</u> Provider allows the Customer to connect to Web Services using a Third Party Device, but Provider does not guarantee that the Third Party Device will be compatible with the Web Services or required software applications. Provider also does not guarantee permanent compatibility with the Web Services or required software applications. Provider is not obligated to offer monetary refunds, Subscription Plan extensions or a replacement device if a Third Party Device is not compatible, becomes incompatible or suffers a hardware fault.

			<h4>Warranties & Limitation of Liability</h4>
			<u>Indemnification by Customer.</u> Customer agrees to defend (or settle), indemnify and hold Provider, its employees, directors and officers harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, or expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with any third party claim that the Customer’s use of the Web Services or Data in violation of this Agreement infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights of any third party, provided that Provider does not make any admission of Customer guilt without Customer’s prior written approval and provided that Provider gives Customer (i) prompt written notification of the claim or action, (ii) sole control and authority over the defense or settlement thereof, and (iii) all reasonably available information, assistance and authority to settle and/or defend any such claim or action.<br><br>

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY.<br><br>

			<u>Accuracy of Data and Third Party Data.</u> PROVIDER MAKES NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE DATA, THIRD PARTY DATA OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION PURCHASED OR OBTAINED THROUGH PROVIDER’S SITE AND/OR THE WEB SERVICES, OR THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, TRUTHFULNESS, COMPLETENESS OR RELIABILITY OF ANY DATA, THIRD PARTY DATA OR OTHER INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH PROVIDER’S WEBSITE AND/OR THE WEB SERVICES.<br><br>

			<u>Limitation of Liability.</u> UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT WILL PROVIDER’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER AND ANY THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OR THEORY OF THE CLAIM OR ACTION. PROVIDER WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR RELIANCE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY INTERRUPTION OR DISRUPTION IN COMMUNICATIONS OR SERVICES, UNAVAILABILITY OR INOPERABILITY OF SERVICES, TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION, LOST DATA, OR LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF PROVIDER KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILTY OF OR COULD HAVE REASONABLY PREVENTED SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

			<h4>Additional Provisions</h4>
			<u>Excusable Delays.</u> Any delay in performance of any provision of this Agreement caused by conditions beyond the reasonable control of either party will not constitute a breach of this Agreement.

			<u>Entire Agreement and Severability.</u> This Agreement, including the Subscription Plan, as amended from time to time according to its terms, shall constitute the entire agreement between Customer and the Provider respecting the Site, the Web Services, the Support, the Data, and the Third Party Data described herein, and shall supersede all prior agreements, arrangements, representations or promises, whether oral or written, as to its subject matter.
